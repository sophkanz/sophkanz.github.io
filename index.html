		<h1>Coding is <span class="upper">fun!</span></h1>  
		<p id="first"> I am not good at it yet but I will be one day. Hopefully.</p>
		<h2>Today is not that day</h2>
		<p> And tomorrow won't be either.</p>
		<h3> Eyes on the prize</h3>
		<p>  It will get easier. But it takes a loooot of work and time. And I mean <em>a lot of time</em> You have no idea. <strong> so much time. </strong></p><br/> 

		You need to make a <span class="upper">list</span> to keep track of the commands. Like this: <br/> 
		<ul><li>put the change in the box. <span class="mono">(git add --all)</span></li><li>seal it by typing in git commit -m and then add a note to it in quotation marks.</li><li>and now send it! Just type in git push</li></ul></p>
