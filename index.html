<html><h1>Coding is fun! </h1>

<p>I am not good at it yet but I will be one day. Hopefully.</p>
<h2>Today is not that day</h2>
<p> And tomorrow won't be either.</p>
<h3> Eyes on the prize</h3>
<p>  It will get easier. But it takes a loooot of work and time. And I mean <em>a lot of time</em> You have no idea. <strong> so much time </strong></p><br/> You need to make a list to keep track of the commands. Like this: <br/> <ul><li>put the change in the box. (git add --all)</li><li>seal it by typing in git commit -m and then add a note to it in quotation marks.</li><li>and now send it! Just type in git push</li></ul></p></html>
